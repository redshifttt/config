# Nix/NixOS Configuration

This is my Nix/NixOS configuration.

This includes my 2 hosts: vesta (PC) and ceres (Laptop).

- `hosts`
    - `vesta` - PC config.
    - `ceres` - Laptop config.
- `home` - Home manager config; contains various subdirectories for individual program configs.
- `packages` - Various custom packages used within my setup.

## Goals

My goal for my configs is functionality then form. I want to try and build the
best habits with the best tools for what I need. That means however everything
has to be optimized for *my* mind and no one elses. :)
