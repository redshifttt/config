# Nix/NixOS Configuration

This is my Nix/NixOS configuration.

## Goals

My goal for my configs is functionality then form. I want to try and build the
best habits with the best tools for what I need. That means however everything
has to be optimized for *my* mind and no one elses. :)

## Acknowledgements
